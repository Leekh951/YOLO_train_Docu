# YOLO Training Script Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an explanation of how to use the `train.py` script for training object detection models, specifically YOLOv8 and RT-DETR models, using a custom dataset. The script is implemented in Python and uses the `ultralytics` library to load and train the models.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `ultralytics` library (`YOLO` and `RTDETR` classes)
- `torch` library for PyTorch operations

You can install the required packages via pip:

```bash
pip install ultralytics torch
